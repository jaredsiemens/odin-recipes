    <p>The perfect <em>Risotto</em> is a delicate, soft creation that inundates
    your mouth with delicios flavours. </p>
    <br>
    <h3><em><b>Ingredients</b></em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, or vegetable stock</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 lb shiitake mushroom(455 g), stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups arborio rice(200 g)</li>
      <li>½ cup white wine(120 mL)</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese(110 g), plus more for serving</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh parsley(10 g), for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em><b>Insutructions</b></em></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once
        the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to low or remove the pan from the
        heat and keep nearby.</li>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. Once the oil
        begins to shimmer, add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until
        translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally,
        until the mushrooms have cooked down.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute,
        until the butter has melted and the garlic is aromatic.</li>
      <li>Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let
        the rice toast for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the white wine and cook until the wine has evaporated, stirring
        occasionally.</li>
      <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring
        frequently, until the stock is fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>Continue to add the stock, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring
        continuously, until the broth is fully absorbed, for 15-20 minutes.
        Depending on how fast the rice cooks, there may be leftover stock.</li>
      <li>Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and
        stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Top with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
